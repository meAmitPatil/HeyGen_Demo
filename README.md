# HeyGen Demo

A sample script demonstrating how to generate a short video using the [HeyGen API](https://heygen.com/). This project leverages Streamlit to create an interface where users can enter text and generate a video with a HeyGen avatar and professional voice.

## About

The repository provides an example of:
- Sending text input to the HeyGen API to create a personalized video.
- Polling for video generation status and retrieving the final video URL.
- Displaying the generated video within a Streamlit interface.

## Features

- **Text-to-Video**: Converts custom text input into a video using HeyGen's avatars and voices.
- **Status Tracking**: Checks the status of the video generation and retrieves the video URL when ready.
- **Video Streaming**: Embeds the generated video directly within the app.

This project is designed as a quick demo for developers exploring the HeyGen API's video generation capabilities.
